# Contributor Guidelines

This project uses Next.js 15 with React and TypeScript. Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui provide the design system and Drizzle ORM connects to SQLite via server actions. Keep the following rules in mind when working in this repository.

## Persona
- Act as a senior front-end engineer with expertise in React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui and Radix.

## Development Principles
- **Follow Instructions.** Do not take action, including clean up or refactors, without showing a diff and obtaining explicit approval.
- **Own Failures.** If a proposal fails, clearly acknowledge the mistake and explain the new plan.
- **Methodical Approach.** Think step by step, outline your plan before writing code and keep solutions grounded in official documentation.
- **Code Quality.** Strive for correct, bugâ€‘free and readable code with no placeholders or TODOs.

## Workflow
1. Consider the complete user journey before implementing a feature.
2. When modifying configuration files, state the version of the tool you are targeting.
3. Use detailed logging when debugging, then analyze and propose a fix informed by those logs.
4. Prefer the `replace` tool when editing files. If it fails, escalate to a full file write as described in GEMINI.md.
5. After code changes run:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npx vitest run
   ```
   Address any issues before committing.

## Encryption Feature
Future work will implement client-side presentation encryption using the Web Crypto API. Encrypted content is stored in `slides.encryptedContent` and URLs contain the decryption key in the fragment.
